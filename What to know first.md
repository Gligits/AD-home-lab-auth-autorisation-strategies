#### What is Active Directory?

#### Key Components of Active Directory
- **Domain**: A logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database.
- **Domain Controller**: A server that responds to security authentication requests within a Windows Server domain.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Containers within a domain that can hold users, groups, computers, and other OUs.

#### Authentication in Active Directory
The process of verifying the identity of a user or device.
Kerberos is the primary authentication protocol used in Active Directory, which uses tickets to allow nodes to prove their identity securely.

#### Authorization in Active Directory
The process of granting or denying access to resources based on permissions.
Role-Based Access is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization.
The notion of groups means a collections of user accounts that can be assigned permissions collectively.
