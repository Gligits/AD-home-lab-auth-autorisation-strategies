In this exercise, we will plan and configure a trust relationship between forests to allow users to access resources in a different forest. The schema below outlines the purpose of this exercise:

**1. Creating the Trust Relationship**  
_______________________________________
First, we create a one-way trust in the first domain, setting it up to allow groups from the other forest.  
Then, we configure the trust on the second domain to specify selective authentication, giving us control over which groups from the first forest can access specific resources in this forest.

**2. Granting Resource Access**  
____________________________
Now that the trust relationship is in place, we focus on granting permissions.  
We select the specific groups from the first forest that need access to a shared folder on a server in the second forest. Using the AGUDLP strategy, we modify folder permissions by adding the appropriate Domain Local Groups in the second domain and nesting the Universal Groups from the first domain inside them, ensuring only the required users have access.

    Workflow in AGUDLP
     Domain1:
     Users → added to Global Groups (G).
     Global Groups (G) → added to Universal Group (U) for access consolidation
     
     Domain2:
     Domain Local Groups (DL) → include Universal Groups (U) from Domain1.
     DL → granted permissions to resources like the "Research" folder.
     
**3. Testing Resource Access as a User**
_______________________________________
To verify our configuration, we log in as one of the users from the first forest and attempt to access the shared folder in the second forest. This test helps us confirm that the user can access the resource as intended and allows us to spot any remaining access restrictions.

-> we can optimize access to make it seamless. We adjust the security settings so that users from the first forest can access the shared folder in the second forest without needing additional authentication prompts.
