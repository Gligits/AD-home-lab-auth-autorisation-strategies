**1. Configuring the Forest for Authentication Policies**
we can set up rules to control how passwords and account security work in the domain. We define policies like how strong passwords need to be and what happens if someone repeatedly enters the wrong password. These rules help improve the overall security of the domain.

Once the policies are configured, we validate their implementation and login as a domain user on a client computer and use command-line tools to ensure the new policies are active:

-> gpupdate /force: Forces the system to immediately apply the updated policies.
-> gpresult /v: Displays detailed results of the applied group policies, helping confirm that the intended password and lockout policies are enforced.
